the aim of the game is to get the highest score possible not getting knocked off the island.

you have your trusty shack to take shelter from the barrage of incoming meteors and your gun that mines resources around you and rebuilds it.

the gun can shoot the meteors to split them up mid-air to avoid some of the damage.

the resources are trees and stones. trees rebuilds the walls and stones rebuild the roof.

you can only carry a max of 4 of any resources at a time use them frequently.
